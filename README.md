# Retraction Check

## What is it?
Prototype for a retraction detection tool that takes .bib files as input and outputs whether any retracted articles are contained in that .bib file and if yes, which articles. 

## How does it work?
The tool works by comparing the DOIs of the articles from the input with those of a list of retracted articles (note: for this prototype only a short sample database containing 24 articles is used to demonstrate functionality.).

## Can I test it?
The prototype is currently hosted with Streamlit Sharing and you can find it under https://share.streamlit.io/floriancaro/retraction-check/app.py.

## Addendum
After finishing this prototype, I was made aware that there already exists an open-source research management tool called Zotero (https://www.zotero.org/about/) that provides the functionality of the prototype at hand.
